*Research Interests*: /Theoretical Computer Science /\n\n I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science. In particular, I am interested in [papersCat.html {{<font color=red size=+0.5><b>}}Computational Complexity{{</b></font>}}] and [papersCat.html {{<font color=red size=+0.5><b>}}Fine-Grained Complexity{{</b></font>}}].
  
I am currently a third year graduate student at MIT, and I am very fortunate to be advised by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/ Ryan Williams]. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Yao Class] at Tsinghua University.

At Tsinghua University, I was advised by Prof. [http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/ Jian Li], working on [papersCat.html /Multi-Armed Bandits/]. During the Spring of 2016, I was visiting MIT, working under the supervision of Prof. [https://www.scottaaronson.com/ Scott Aaronson] on [papersCat.html /Quantum Complexity/]. [CV.pdf \[CV\]]

I was visiting [https://simons.berkeley.edu/ Simons Institute] in the Fall of 2018.

{Summary} 
/We showed (among many other things) finding the furthest pair among n points in 2^(log\* n) dimensional Euclidian space\n
requires essentialy n^2 time under SETH. We also use the sqrt(n) BQP communication protocol for Set-Disjointness to establish \n
inapproximbility results for problems in P./\n
