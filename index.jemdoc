== About Me
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics, The University of Hong Kong. My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning and learning theory, with emphasis on the following topics: online learning, deep learning and stochastic optimization. In particular, I am interested in developing and analyzing scalable optimization methods for large-scale learning problems. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University, and my Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Hunan University. 

+Open Positions+: I am looking for self-motivated PhD students with strong mathematical ablities and (or) programming skills. If you are interested in working on learning theory and optimization with me, please feel free to send me your CV and your detailed transcripts.
